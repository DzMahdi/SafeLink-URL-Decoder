### SafeLink URL Decoder

SafeLink URL Decoder is a Python script designed to decode SafeLink URLs and reveal their final destination. It handles nested URLs and removes fragments to provide a clean final URL.

Example of a SafeLink URL:
```

```

#### How It Works
1. **Enter SafeLink URL**: Users enter the SafeLink URL when prompted by the script.
2. **Decode URL**: The script decodes the 'url' parameter from the SafeLink URL.
3. **Check for Additional URL**: If the decoded URL contains another URL inside it, that URL is also decoded.
4. **Remove Fragment**: The script removes any fragment from the final URL.
5. **Print Final URL**: The clean final URL is printed.

#### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the SafeLink URL when prompted.
3. The script will print the final decoded URL.
